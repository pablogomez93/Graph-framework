Graph Framework
===============

A framework to create and control graphs in C++, with the possibility of choosing one of the two most common graph implementations, which are based on *adjacencies lists* or *adjacencies matrix*. Also oriented/non-oriented mode is eligible.<br/>
This framework allows you export the graph as a visual image like the following:
![](graph2.png)

Some of the most important features are:
* Support for oriented/non-oriented mode.
* Support for weighted/unweighted mode.
* The base implementation can be based on adyacencies lists or adjacencies matrix, elegible by the user.
* Neighbors iterator, to iterate only over the neighbors of a given node in an efficient way, using the base implementation selected by the user.
* Optimal performance for each basic operation (following the representation mode selected by the user).
* Export to a graphic format, to see the current graph dumped on an image.
* Many useful methods available for the most common needs of a graph.

[//]: # (BFS Iterator to iterate throw the nodes in a BFS way.)

## Usage
A real example of usage can be found on my [Dijkstra's Algorithm implementation](https://github.com/pablogomez93/Dijkstra). Also, there is a example.cpp file in this repository with a little example of usage, to watch it compile and run just use make all && make run.<br/>

To create a new Graph just use one of the following constructors:
```c++
//Creates an empty graph, non-oriented and based on adjacencies matrix
Graph g();
```
```c++
//Identical previous but initialized with nodes_count nodes
Graph g(unsigned int nodes_count);
```
```c++
//Identical previous but orientation prop specified
Graph g(unsigned int nodes_count, bool is_oriented);
```
```c++
//Identical previous but implementation specified, it can be ADJACENCIES_MATRIX or ADJACENCIES_LIST
Graph g(unsigned int nodes_count, bool is_oriented, Graph::IMPL implementation);
```
Then you are ready to use one of the available methods ([Full documentation here](#documentation)), for example:
```c++
#include "graph.h"
//...
unsigned int nodes = 10;
Graph g(nodes, true);
for (unsigned int current = 1; current < nodes; current++) {
    g.applyEdge(0, current);
    g.applyEdge(current, nodes-1);
    
    g.paintNode(rand()%nodes); //Paint random nodes
}
cout << g.getDOT(false);
```
Then, executing the previous code and dumping it, will give us a visual image of the graph:

    ./example | dot -Tpng -o graph.png

## Tests and Stress tests

There are also included a test suite which run some test to check the correcteness of the graph actions.<br/>
To run the included test you just must execute:

    make test

There is an stress_test too to put the graph under presion and check if it supports the charge.<br/>
If you wanna run it, you must be careful because it may put slow your computer for a while. To run it just do:

    make stress_test

## Documentation

Let ```V``` be the set of nodes of the graph and ```E``` the set of edges.
Also, let ```n``` be equals to ```|V|``` and ```m``` equals to ```|E|```.

In this implementation, the nodes are identified by non-negative integers strarting from 0 (inclusive) to n-1 (inclusive), the assigned integer for each node is assigned in order of arrival, in other words, the first node added to the graph will be assigned to the number 0, the next node to the number 1, and so on until the last node will be assigned to the number n-1.

About the edges, they are represented by a pair of nodes *(a, b)* where *a* and *b* are the ends of the edge and, if the graph is oriented, *a* is the origin and *b* is the destination. This led that there are as much ```n*(n-1)/2``` different edges in a non-oriented graph, and ```n*(n-1)``` in an oriented one.<br/>
Each edge may or may not have a specified numeric (float) weight on it, it is optional at the time to add the edge to the graph (it is an optional parameter). If none weight is provided at the time to create the edge, the default weight is 1.<br/>
The weight of the edges can be thought as the distance between a pair of nodes (the ends nodes of the edge). Hence, if you ask from the distance or weight of an edge that has not been already added to the graph, the answer will be the ```DEFAULT_WEIGHT``` constant which is the infinity float value.<br/>

To be ending, the space used by this framework is *O(m+n)* if adjacencies lists is the selected implementation, and, in the other hand, *O(n²)* on the adjacencies matrix implementation.

### Available methods:

### Neighbors/Adjacencies Iterator:
This framework also includes a neighbors iterator for a given node. It provides the member functions to advance the iterator, ask for the current, and check if there is more neighbors before advance; this are the most necessary things to iterate over the neighbors.
#### Constructor
To get an AdjacentsIterator just use the ***adjacentsOf*** method of a graph instance (see the documentation of this [method](#adjacentsof) above), which returns a new iterator of type AdjacentsIterator for a single node *v*.
#### Available iterator methods:
##### next
***Description:*** Get the current neighbor pointed by the iterator. To advance to the next neighbor, use the ***.advance*** method.<br/>
***Exception safety:*** This operation never throw exception if the iterator was advanced carefuly (with the ***.thereIsMore*** method), otherwise, the result is undefined behavior.<br/>
***Returns:*** A pair containing the number of the neighbor node and the weight of the edge between both nodes.

***Exception safety:*** This operation never throw exception, but ***.thereIsMore*** method must be used before to check if exists another neighbor. If that is not checked before, the result is undefined behavior.<br/>
***Returns:*** None

##### thereIsMore
***Description:*** Test if exists another neighbor to visit, if it is true, the use of ***.advance*** and ***.next*** functions is safety.<br/>
***Exception safety:*** This operation never throw exception.<br/>
***Returns:*** A boolean value indicating if exists remaining neighbors to visit. True if exists at least one.
